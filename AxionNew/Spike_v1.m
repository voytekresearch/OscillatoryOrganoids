classdef Spike_v1 < Waveform
    %SPIKE_V1: An extension of Waveform that represents a spike recorded by
    %          spike detector in Axis.
    %
    %   TriggerSampleOffset: Offset (in samples) from the start of the
    %                        waveform where the spike detector was
    %                        triggered
    %
    %   StandardDeviation:   RMS voltage value of the signal noise at the
    %                        time the spike was caputred
    %
    %   ThresholdMultiplier: Multiplier(if applicable) of the RMS Noise that was 
    %                        used as the trigger voltage for this spike
